  As a student, I want to view course videos in LMS

  # 1
  Scenario: Multiple videos in sequentials all load and work, switching between sequentials
    Given I am registered for the course "test_course"
    And it has a video "A" in "Youtube" mode in position "1" of sequential
    And a video "B" in "HTML5" mode in position "1" of sequential
    And a video "C" in "Youtube" mode in position "1" of sequential
    And a video "D" in "Youtube" mode in position "1" of sequential
    And a video "E" in "Youtube" mode in position "2" of sequential
    And a video "F" in "Youtube" mode in position "2" of sequential
    And a video "G" in "Youtube" mode in position "2" of sequential
    And I open the section with videos
    Then video "A" should start playing at speed "1.0"
    And I select the "2.0" speed on video "B"
    And I select the "2.0" speed on video "C"
    And I select the "2.0" speed on video "D"
    When I open video "E"
    Then video "E" should start playing at speed "2.0"
    And I select the "1.0" speed on video "F"
    And I select the "1.0" speed on video "G"
    When I open video "A"
    Then video "A" should start playing at speed "2.0"

  Scenario: Video component stores speed correctly when each video is in separate sequence
    Given I am registered for the course "test_course"
    And it has a video "A" in "Youtube" mode in position "1" of sequential
    And a video "B" in "Youtube" mode in position "2" of sequential
    And a video "C" in "HTML5" mode in position "3" of sequential
    And I open the section with videos
    And I select the "2.0" speed on video "A"
    And I select the "0.50" speed on video "B"
    When I open video "C"
    Then video "C" should start playing at speed "0.75"
    When I open video "A"
    Then video "A" should start playing at speed "2.0"
    And I reload the page with video
    When I open video "A"
    Then video "A" should start playing at speed "2.0"
    And I select the "1.0" speed on video "A"
    When I open video "B"
    Then video "B" should start playing at speed "0.50"
    When I open video "C"
    Then video "C" should start playing at speed "1.0"

#  Scenario: Youtube video has correct transcript if fields for other speeds are filled
#    Given I am registered for the course "test_course"
#    And I have a "subs_OEoXaMPEzfM.srt.sjson" transcript file in assets
#    And I have a "subs_b7xgknqkQk8.srt.sjson" transcript file in assets
#    And it has a video in "Youtube" mode:
#      | sub         | youtube_id_1_5 |
#      | OEoXaMPEzfM | b7xgknqkQk8    |
#    And I make sure captions are opened
#    Then I see "Hi, welcome to Edx." text in the captions
#    And I select the "1.50" speed
#    And I reload the page with video
#    Then I see "Hi, welcome to Edx." text in the captions
    # The 1:56 time is the duration from metadata. 1:54 time is the duration reported
    # by the video API once the video starts playing. The next step is correct because
    # "1:56" is the duration in the VCR timer before the video plays.
#    And I see duration "1:56"

  # 3
  Scenario: Verify that each video in each sub-section includes a transcript for non-Youtube countries

      | {"zh": "chinese_transcripts.srt"} |
    And a video "D" in "Youtube_HTML5" mode in position "3" of sequential
    And I open the section with videos
    Then videos have rendered in "HTML5" mode
    And I see text in the captions:
      | text                |
      | Hi, welcome to Edx. |
